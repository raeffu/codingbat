/*
 * For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 
 * if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. 
 * Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost
 * digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. 
 * Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. 
 * To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper 
 * "public int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times. 
 * Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum(). 
 * 
 * roundSum(16, 17, 18) = 60
 * roundSum(12, 13, 14) = 30
 * roundSum(6, 4, 4) = 10
